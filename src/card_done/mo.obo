def: "A mutation or sequence variant that confers elevated resistance to antibiotic(s) relative to wild type. The most common encoded in the CARD is an amino acid substitution gleaned from the literature with format [wild-type][position][mutation], e.g. R184Q. Single or multiple amino acid substitutions can be present in a single gene or across multiple genes to confer resistance to antibiotic(s). In addition, there are insertions and deletions within genome sequences that confer elevated resistance towards antibiotic(s)." []

def: "The Reverse Antibiotic model applies to cases where a drug acts on a mutant form of a protein, thus counteracting conferred resistance from the mutation. An example of this is the relationship between nybomycin and quinolones: the S84L mutation in gyrA confers resistance to quinolones, but creates the required binding site for nybomycin to act on the mutant gyrA. Nybomycin in this case is therefore considered a Reverse Antibiotic (RA) as it acts on the mutant protein." []
